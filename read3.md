# **Semantics**: n programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?"
## Semantics in JavaScript :
 In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent 

 # Semantics in CSS:
 In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?


# Semantics in HTML:
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
