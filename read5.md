# **Operators**
## JavaScript has the following types of operators:
- Assignment operators :    x = y
- Comparison operators: _A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values._    
- Arithmetic operators :An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Bitwise operators: A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001.
- Logical operators:Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value
- String operators:In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.
- Conditional (ternary) operator:The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.
 The syntax is:condition ? val1 : val2
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

# _JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:_
