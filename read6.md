# **What is CSS?**
# *CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.*

# CSS syntax
# CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."

# Three Ways to Insert CSS
# There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
- External CSS: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
- Internal CSS: An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
- Inline CSS: An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property
